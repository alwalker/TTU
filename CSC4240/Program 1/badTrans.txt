	I left the mother and childhood responses out here because they are both clearly good and bad responses.  While they both will usually be true, they were intended more as a crack on Freudian psychology than meaningful responses.  The [14] and the first [22] fail due to improper pronoun substitution.  The last fails because love is not recognized and my binds to a bad thought.  The other's simply incorrectly place patterns in the return list.
