   To Compile the program simply type make.  To run the program type ./Wumplus_World -a mapname for the agent or -u mapname to play the game yourself.  
   To compile the map generate type gcc Wumplus_Map_Generator.  It takes two arguments, the size of the map and a name for the file that will be created.
   More detailed descriptions can be found in the block comments at the begging of both Wumplus_World.c and Wumplus_Map_Generator.c
